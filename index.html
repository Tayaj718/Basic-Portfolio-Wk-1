      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        What do you get when you put a gaming, nerdy, Ninja plus a classy, girly, goofy, fashionista together? You get a TAYANA! Those are my parents described by the way and this is why I am the best of both worlds. Hello World! Welcome to my page. 

      </p>

        My name is Tayana but I prefer to go by ‘Ty’ or ‘Taya’ and I am from Brooklyn, New York. I enjoy long walks on the beach, under a moonlit sky, with the breeze flowing through my hair. JUST KIDDING! I’m what you call a Jack of All Trades. I enjoy fun activities such as gaming, hiking, bike riding, laser tag, and basketball games. However, I also enjoy mani/pedis, shopping, and some cute girly stuff. Always up for trying something new even if I fail, at least I tried. I look forward to providing you guys with great content!
